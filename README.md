Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project that provides a personalized credit score prediction, estimates the loan approval rate, and includes an interactive chatbot to offer financial suggestions. The project is designed to assist users in making informed decisions regarding loan applications and improving their financial well-being.

Project Overview
The project is divided into three main components:

Credit Score Prediction Model: A machine learning model that takes relevant financial data as input and predicts the user's credit score. The model is trained on historical credit data and uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

Loan Approval Rate: Based on the predicted credit score and additional user information, the project provides an estimate of the user's loan approval rate. This helps users gauge their chances of getting a loan approved before applying.

Chatbot for Suggestions: The interactive chatbot provides personalized financial suggestions based on the user's credit score, financial history, and loan eligibility. It assists users in understanding their financial standing and offers tips to improve their credit score and overall financial health.

Credit Score Prediction Model
The credit score prediction model is built using supervised machine learning techniques. It takes various features such as income, age, credit history, etc., as input and predicts the credit score of the user. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of historical credit data, and evaluation metrics are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

Loan Approval Rate
The loan approval rate is estimated based on the predicted credit score and additional user information, including the loan amount, loan term, and employment status. Keep in mind that the estimated approval rate is not a guarantee, but it can provide valuable insights into the likelihood of loan approval.

Chatbot for Suggestions
The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide personalized financial suggestions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and respond accordingly. Users can ask the chatbot questions about their credit score, loan eligibility, and tips for improving their creditworthiness.
